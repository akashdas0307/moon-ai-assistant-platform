# Head Agent Working Notebook

> **Purpose:** This is my working memory. I write notes to myself here about pending tasks,
> important context, and things to remember. The SPARK heartbeat checks this file periodically
> to see if there are any pending items that need attention.

## Instructions for Writing Notes
- Use clear, actionable language
- Mark tasks with `[PENDING]` prefix
- Mark completed tasks with `[COMPLETED]` prefix
- Include relevant context and deadlines
- Completed items are auto-archived to archived_notebook.md
